# Terraria-clone
Terraria clone, made using C++ with OpenGL(and else GLFW for widow, glm for math and glew for load OpenGL functions). Now, compiled only for Linux.

For build the project, type `make && make run` in terminal, in projects folder.
Also, maybe you need to download some libraries, like glfw, glew, glm and etc. 
For this, type `sudo pacman -S glfw glew glm`
